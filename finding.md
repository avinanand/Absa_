Finding from the data and model

# for both of the models and specially for aspect prediction we need  to train with cross validation
 # for aspect Stratified cross validation is needed, because data is unbalanced 
 
1.For Sentiment Analysis:
	Given data has 67% positive values and 33% negative values
	Model has predicted 68% positive and 32% negative values
	
2. For Aspect Prediction:

  given data has general - 35%, price - 15%, others - 51%
	
	model predicted has general - 36%, price - 11%, others - 52%
	
for sentiment model, it can be better if we do some finetuning and change the differen models

for aspect model data is very less and only 4 aspects has enought data others has very less data so model is not

able to learn and predict
